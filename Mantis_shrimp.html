  <h1>True facts about mantis shrimp</h1>
    <p>Mantis shrimps are predators which kill their prey by hitting
      them at high speed. They have large complex eyes and are highly
      coloured.</p>

  <h2>Attack</h2>
  <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be <strong>spearers</strong> or
    <em>smashers</em>.</p>
    <p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey,
      and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.</p>
  <h2>Eyesight</h2>
    <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about
      independently of each other. They are considered to be the most
      complex eyes in the animal kingdom. </p>
    <p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes it can perceive both
      polarized light, and colour vision outside the normal visual
      spectrum.</p>
